Introduction to Embedded Rust

Speaker: James Munns and Florian Gilcher
Level: Intermediate (audience must be comfortable writing basic Rust programs)

Abstract:

This training is aimed at developers who are familiar with Rust and/or embedded systems, and are looking to learn more about embedded Rust. The exercise driven class will provide a guided experience of writing embedded application code and is divided into two segments.
The first segment lets students get to know their hardware and the embedded Rust tooling. They will take an existing template project and gain familiarity with building, running, and debugging an embedded application. The goal is to blink the onboard LEDs and eventually create blinking patterns.
For the second segment, a color grid will be displayed on the presenter's projector screen, and each student will be given a portion of the total grid that they may remotely draw on by sending radio packets. This involves using the BSP interface and learning about serde and automatic serialisation of Rust data structures. Patterns, such as gradients, shapes, letters or simple animations can be drawn.
Participants should bring their own laptops. Additional machine setup instructions will be sent ~1 week prior to the training.
