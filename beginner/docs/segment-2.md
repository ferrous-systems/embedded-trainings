# Segment 2 detailed instructions

This segment aims to allow the students to stretch their legs, and make some larger modifications to the template given in Segment 1. Students will be asked to implement a sweeping ["K.I.T.T"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxE2xWZNfOc) or ["Cylon Eye"](https://media.giphy.com/media/2gWGC0m2zBLsQ/giphy.gif) LED pattern using the four LEDs found on the board.

Students are encouraged to take advantage of features in Rust, such as iterators, to implement their LED patterns. As a stretch goal, students may implement multiple patterns, cycling through them sequentially, alternating patterns randomly, or switching based on some sort of external input, such as a button press.

## Part 0: Instructor Notes

First, your instructor will give a bit more detail about the `dwm1001` crate, a Board Support Crate for our hardware. In Rust, "Crates" are libraries that They will explain how code is composed in embedded Rust projects, including:

* Peripheral Access Crates, or "PAC"s
* Hardware Abstraction Layers, or "HAL crate"s
* Board Support Crates, or "BSC"s
* Driver Crates, such as for the `DW1000` radio
* Embedded HAL, A crate for providing traits to write portable code

## Part 1: Building a Pattern

The goal of this segment is to implement a pattern of sweeping or scanning LEDs. Your pattern should move back and forth on the four LEDs contained on the development board, and should loop endlessly. You may choose a pattern you think looks best, but consider implementing a pattern that looks like this:

```
. - an unlit LED
# - a lit LED

pattern
------- time
#...     |
##..     |
###.     |
.###     |
..##     |
...#     |
..##     |
.###     |
###.     |
##..     |
#...     V
```

You may consider pausing at the end of each side of the LEDs, or varying the speed or acceleration of the LED pattern. To guide you trough this, we provided hints in the hints folder. 

## Part 2: More than one pattern

When you have tested a few different possible patterns, you may want to implement multiple patterns. Consider making each of these patterns a function, and cycle through the patterns by calling each function.

## Part 3: Random Patterns

You can also look at the documentation for this board, and use the random number generator to pick a random pattern after each pattern completes.

You can look at the documentation of the `dwm1001` crate, and the re-exported components of the `nrf52832-hal` crate to review the documentation for the `rng` module.

## Part 4: Using the Button

The DWM1001-DEV includes a single user button. This button is connected to Pin `P0.02` of the nRF52832. You can use the `Gpio` module of the HAL crate to read the value of the button.

Consider toggling the pattern when the user has pressed the button.
